# COVID19 Analysis

The COVID19 Analysis is repo with a series of notebooks to assist analysts with manipulating and analysing time series data from various sources available online.

## Required files

All the data is available online.

## Summary

The dataset we will be using is the Time Series Summary collected by the Johns Hopkins University. The data is updated on the Github repository [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

We will be looking into three files:

- [time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
- [time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
- [time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)

As stated in the Github repo, the "Three time series tables are for the global confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths. Australia, Canada and China are reported at the province/state level. Dependencies of the Netherlands, the UK, France and Denmark are listed under the province/state level. The US and other countries are at the country level..."

Since we have daily numbers of the pandemic on a global, we can ask numerous questions once we have explored, preprocessed and analysed the data. Let us have explore one of the files to gather a preliminary idea of the available data. In this case, we will be looking at how we can compare

- different states within a country
- different countries
- daily new cases
- ...

## Tasks

The preprocessing and analysis has been broken down into two notebooks, WorkBook1 and WorkBook2, as discussed below.
